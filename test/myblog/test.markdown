layout: page
title: Test
permalink: /test/

Does this work? Yes it does

To build this page:

* I made a markdown file in the base folder (myblog)

* Which refrences to a /test/ folder under _site/

* Inside _site/test there is an index html file with all the information

This is a test to see if I can link to a post [here](_site/jekyll/update/2020/06/30/2020-06-30-welcome-to-jekyll.html)
